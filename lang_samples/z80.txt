; This program will add two numbers and store the result in the HL register pair.

    ORG 0x100          ; Set the starting address of the program in memory (common for many Z80 systems)

START:
    LD A, 5            ; Load the value 5 into the accumulator (A register)
    LD B, 3            ; Load the value 3 into the B register

    ADD A, B           ; Add the value in the B register to the value in the A register
                        ; The result will be stored back in the A register (A = A + B)

    LD H, A            ; Store the result (in A) into the high byte of HL register pair (H = result)
    LD L, 0            ; Store 0 into the low byte of HL register pair (L = 0)

    NOP                 ; No operation (just a placeholder instruction)
    HALT                ; Halt the program
