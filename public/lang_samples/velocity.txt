# This is a simple Velocity template
Hello, $name!

# Conditional Example
# If the user is an admin, greet them as an administrator
# Otherwise, greet them as a regular user
# The condition checks if the value of $role is 'admin'

# Checking if the role is admin
# You can replace this with the actual data provided by your application

# Checking condition using #if directive
#if ($role == 'admin')
  Welcome, Administrator $name!
#else
  Welcome, User $name!
#end

# Looping Example
# Here we loop through a list of items

# Let's assume $items is a list of items passed to the template
# Each item in the list is printed

# Checking if the items list is not empty
#if ($items.size() > 0)
  Here are your items:
  #foreach($item in $items)
    - $item
  #end
#else
  You have no items.
#end
